# HungeReady-and-HungeReadyToDrive?
## How it works
- **HungeReady** basically helps the merchant organize his orders and manage deliveries within his business. This includes monitoring delivery, dine-in and pick-up requests. The system also tracks **HungeReadyToDrive?** drivers that accept delivery requests posted via **HungeReadyToDrive?**.  

- **HungeReadyToDrive?** links to a particular **HungeReady** user’s system when he receives a request for delivery and accepts it. It gives drivers the flexibility to accept the delivery request if they are able to fulfill it. It is a platform that allows users to sign up as delivery drivers while also keeping a track of current deliveries, past deliveries and earnings.
